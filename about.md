I am Shivanshu, a third year UG student at IIT Kanpur studying Computer Science and Engineering. I have the super awesome hobby of reading novels. I am best friends with my kindle. Other things that interest me (not equally but enough)are movies and programming/hacking. You may also know me as coordinator of Programming Club IIT Kanpur or coordinator  of VANI, IIT Kanpur or the person whose site has a weird name.
