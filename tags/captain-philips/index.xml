      <description>If you are gonna shoot somebody, you shoot me. I&amp;rsquo;m the captain, not them.
  In the direst of situations when one of the pirates has a gun cocked to a crew-member&amp;rsquo;s head threatening to kill him if the captain did not reveal where the other crew members were hiding, he had the guts to say this.
The story is based on the hijacking of an american ship - MV Maersk Alabama by Somali pirate in 2009.</description>
