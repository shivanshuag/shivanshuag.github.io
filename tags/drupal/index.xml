      <description>Today has been great for me in many ways. I reached the 1000 friends mark on fb, scored good in an exam. But the best thing that happened to me today is getting accepted into Google Summer Of Code&#39;14.
This is the first time I applied in this program and getting selected has been nothing less than pure bliss. I am exaggerating a little here but there is that feeling that lasts just for a few seconds.</description>
