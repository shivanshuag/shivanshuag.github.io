      <description>As a part of my GSoC project, I have been recently writing functional tests for site_audit &amp;ndash; a Drush extension that provides drush commands for static analysis of a Drupal site. The process seemed painful at first due to lack of good documentation and gaps in my knowledge of Drush and PHPUnit. But, after a few hiccups intially, I was successfully able to write tests for Site Audit.
Background Drush uses PHPUnit testing framework for testing its core commands.</description>

      <description>I was selected for Google Summer Of Code 2015 program under Drupal. My project is to extend Site Audit under the mentorship of Jon Peck and my proposal for the project can be found here.
Weeks before the coding period started, the first challenge was to set up a developemnt environment such that both me and my mentor can test the work I do in a consistent way. Following are some of the things I did and learned in the process.</description>
