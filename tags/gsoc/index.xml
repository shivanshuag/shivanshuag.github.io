      <description>I am porting a drupal 7 module named securesite to drupal 8 under of Google Summer Of Code&#39;14. It has been two weeks into the coding period and I am thoroughly enjoying it. This is my first port in a series of posts that I plan to write during this period.
One look at a drupal 8 module is enough to make you realize that there have been some major changes in its architecture.</description>

      <description>Today has been great for me in many ways. I reached the 1000 friends mark on fb, scored good in an exam. But the best thing that happened to me today is getting accepted into Google Summer Of Code&#39;14.
This is the first time I applied in this program and getting selected has been nothing less than pure bliss. I am exaggerating a little here but there is that feeling that lasts just for a few seconds.</description>
