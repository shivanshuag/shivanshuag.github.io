      <description>As a part of my GSoC project, I have been recently writing functional tests for site_audit &amp;ndash; a Drush extension that provides drush commands for static analysis of a Drupal site. The process seemed painful at first due to lack of good documentation and gaps in my knowledge of Drush and PHPUnit. But, after a few hiccups intially, I was successfully able to write tests for Site Audit.
Background Drush uses PHPUnit testing framework for testing its core commands.</description>
